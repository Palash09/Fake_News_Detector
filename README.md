# Fake_News_Detector
This python script detects fake news with the help of passive aggressive classifier.

The fake news detector is implemented by using keras library. The concept of tfidf is user here for providing weightage to the 
words for finding whether news is fake or not.

For classifier, Passive Aggressive Classifier is used for classifying the news based on the training of the classifier.

With the help of this classifier, I could achieve an accuracy of 93% with the dataset which was available.
